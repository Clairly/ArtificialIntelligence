Things to check for deciding where to go with current info in priority order, if 
something cant be avoided cause of a previous condition then ignore it and do the 
dont. This is the decision algorithm for when having some info about the room.

- dont hit walls
- dont go back to last visited square
- dont go to visited squares

Some intresting information, if we have two walls around a empty square, we have 
a corridorlike structure. We should save these points so we know where to go if 
we get stuck in a confined space. If a confined space have to entrances we need 
to clear the whole area before leaving. This is not really possible, cause we 
dunno if its a confined space before.

greedy algorithm
Move to the closest unknown that cost the least.
