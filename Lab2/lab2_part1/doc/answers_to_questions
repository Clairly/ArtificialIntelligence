1. In the vacuum cleaner domain in part 1, what were the states and actions? 
What is the branching factor?

2. What is the difference between Breadth First Search and Uniform Cost Search 
in a domain where the cost of each action is 1?

3. Suppose that h1 and h2 are admissible heuristics (used in for example A*). 
Which of the following are also admissible?
a) (h1+h2)/2
b) 2h1
c) max (h1,h2)

4. If one would use A* to search for a path to one specific square in the vacuum 
domain, what could the heuristic (h) be? The cost function (g)? Is it an 
admissible heuristic?

5. Draw and explain. Choose your three favorite search algorithms and apply them
 to any problem domain (it might be a good idea to use a domain where you can 
identify a good heuristic function). Draw the search tree for them, and explain 
how they proceed in the searching. Also include the memory usage. You can attach 
a hand-made drawing.

6. Look at all the offline search algorithms presented in chapter 3 plus A* 
search. Are they complete? Are they optimal? Explain why!

7. Assume that you had to go back and do lab 1 once more, but this time with 
obstacles. Remember that the agent did not have perfect knowledge of the 
environment but had to explore it incrementally. Could you still use the search 
algorithms you have learned to guide the agent's execution? What would you 
search for? Give an example.
